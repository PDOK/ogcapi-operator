                            resource refers to a resource metric (such as those specified in
                            requests and limits) known to Kubernetes describing each pod in the
                            current scale target (e.g. CPU or memory). Such metrics are built in to
                            Kubernetes, and have special scaling options on top of those available
                            to normal per-pod metrics using the "pods" source.
